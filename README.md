# 3DOrigamiProject
Converts an image to instructions to create a physical, 3D origami version of it

## About
##### This project was originally created back in 2019 when I was a high school senior with little to no coding knowledge. I have since revisted this project in order to improve the efficiency and debug it so that I can eventually share it with other 3D origami enthusiasts. I hope to update it with the new knowledge I gain from my Computer Science classes in college.
